You are evaluating a single research paper's relevance to a specific user.

Carefully analyze the paper against the user's profile, interests, projects, and constraints.

## Scoring (1-5)

- **5**: Directly addresses one of the user's explicitly stated interests (e.g., "small language models", "multimodal", "few-shot", "agentic LLM")
- **4**: Addresses a related topic that would clearly benefit their work OR solves a problem they have (e.g., compute efficiency for someone with limited VRAM)
- **3**: Generally relevant to their field (ML/CV) but no specific connection to their stated interests
- **2**: Tangential - different subfield, unlikely to be useful
- **1**: Completely unrelated to their domain

NOTE: If the paper topic matches something the user explicitly listed in their interests, that's at least a 4. Don't be overly conservative.

## Your Assessment Must Include:

1. **Score**: X/5
2. **Relevance to user**: How does this paper connect to THEIR specific interests? Reference their profile.
3. **Potential value**: What could they gain from reading this?
4. **Key match**: Which of the user's stated interests does this align with? (or "none" if no direct match)

Be specific. Reference the user's stated interests, their GitHub projects, their constraints.
