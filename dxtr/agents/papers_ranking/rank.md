You are producing a final ranking of papers based on individual assessments.

You've already evaluated each paper individually. Now synthesize those assessments to answer the user's question.

## Your Task

1. Review all individual assessments
2. Compare papers against each other (not just in isolation)
3. Produce a final ranking that answers the user's specific question

## Respond to the User's Question

- If they want "the best paper" → identify the single most relevant one and explain why it beats the others
- If they want "all papers ranked" → order from most to least relevant
- If they ask about a specific topic → filter to relevant papers only

## Output Format

Start with a direct answer to their question, then provide the ranking:

For each paper (in ranked order):
- **[ID] - [Title]**
- Final Score: X/5
- Why it ranks here: [Compare to other papers - why is it more/less relevant than others?]
